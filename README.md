# Click-Counter-App-Using-React-State

Project Features
Display a number (count) starting from 0

Two buttons: Increment and Decrement

State updates instantly when clicked

In this Project, I created a simple Click Counter Application using React State. The App is interactive as the interface gives users the luxury of increasing or decreasing the count using its respective buttons.

In setting up the component, useState hook was use to store and update the counter value.

in line with the project specification, two buttons were added (increment and decrement). This provide a user interface for interacting with the counter which also updates in real-time when any of the button is clicked. The display provides a dynamic view with every clik.

Other structure of React which were used in the project includes: main.jsx, index.css, tailwind.config.js, etc.. App.jsx changes to use state.

To run the Application, you can follow the following steps:

Open dist/index.html in your browser — you’ll see the counter (interactive display)

Edit & run with state (dev mode):

Open the folder in VSCode.

Run:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm install
npm run dev
Open the localhost link — the counter will work with Increment/Decrement buttons.

Thank you
